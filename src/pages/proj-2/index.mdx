# Project 2 - Transformations Demo

<p.TransformDemo client:load />

Notice how a translation, followed by a rotation, followed by the inverse translation allows us to rotate about an axis displaced from the origin. In this example, try adjusting the y rotation and notice how it rotates around the axis through one of the edges of the pyramid.

export const t1 = new p.TranslateTransform(0.2, 0, 0)
export const transforms = [
  t1,
  new p.RotateTransform(50, p.Axis.Y),
  new p.InvertTransform(t1.id)
]

<p.TransformDemo client:load initial_transforms={transforms}/>
