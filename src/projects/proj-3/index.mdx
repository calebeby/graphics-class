# Project 3 - Scene/Models

Navigate around the scene by using the cursor position to change the angle you're facing, and use (press and hold) W/A/S/D to navigate. Movements can be combined.

Beware of flying cats! The stick-figure thing is supposed to look like Kermit but I didn't have time to model the face and the proportions are still off. But believe it or not I modeled the fingers!

Also there is a random icosahedron cuz icosahedrons are cool :)
