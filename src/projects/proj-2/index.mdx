# Project 2 - Transformations Demo

Here is the base demo, with no transforms set up initially! Feel free to fiddle with it, or read through the more guided demos below it.

<p.TransformDemo client:load />

## Translation

This translates in the +Y direction (up on the screen). +X is towards the right of the screen, and +Z is into the screen. Observe that the +Z transform is not noticable until a perspective value is set.

If the vertices end up outside the preset boundaries, the shapes will be clipped.

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[new t.TranslateTransform(0, 0.5, 0)]}
/>

## Scale

Scaling lets us squish/stretch the shape on different axes.

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[new t.ScaleTransform(0.5, 1.5, 1.0)]}
/>

## Reflection

This mirrors the vertices across one of the planes. In this case, it is reflected across the X axis. Notice that the produced transformation matrix is the same as when Scale X is set to -1 and Scale Y and Z are set to 1.

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[new t.ReflectTransform(t.Axis.X)]}
/>

## Skew

This demo shows skew! The two parameters, S and T, control how the third axis affects the selected axes.

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[new t.SkewTransform(0.5, 0, t.Axis.X)]}
/>

## Rotation

This demo rotates the pyramid 45Â° around the Y axis. Fiddle with the axis of rotation, animate the rotation angle, and try adding an additional rotation transform afterwards!

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[new t.RotateTransform(45, t.Axis.Y)]}
/>

## Inversion

This demo uses inversion of a transform to perform a rotation around an axis offset from the origin.

Notice how a translation, followed by a rotation, followed by the inverse translation allows us to rotate about an axis displaced from the origin. In this example, try adjusting the y rotation and notice how it rotates around the axis through one of the edges of the pyramid.

export const translateTransform = new t.TranslateTransform(0.2, 0, 0);

<p.TransformDemo
  client:load
  initial_transforms={[
    translateTransform,
    new t.RotateTransform(50, t.Axis.Y),
    new t.InvertTransform(translateTransform.id),
  ]}
/>
